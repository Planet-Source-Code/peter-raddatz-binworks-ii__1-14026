## BinWorks II


</div>

### Description

BinWorks was cool. Written in PB it provided Bin$, Rotates etc.. Well step over BinWorks here is BinWorks II with much more speed and a few extras. Mind you the Bindll.dll was written in C, but it was written with VB in mind and the emphasis on SPEED. The Functions are provided for BYTEs, INTEGERs and LONGs... Var2Bin, Bin2Var, VarArray2BinArray, BinArray2VarArray, Var2Hex, Hex2Var, VarArray2HexArray, HexArray2VarArray, VarLeftRotate, VarRightRotate, VarLeftShift, VarRightShift, VarBitToggle.

Rotates rotate 15 bit Ints and 31 bit Longs correctly. Enjoy!

C - source code for the DLL is to be found in the psc-C section!
