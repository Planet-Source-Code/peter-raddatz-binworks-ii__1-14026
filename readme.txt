The, enclosed, bindll.dll should be put somewhere where your computer
can find it, like C:\Windows.

When using these Subs & Functions make sure that you optimize your
compile with: speed, Pentium Pro and all Advanced optimization options
turned on. That way you experience the fastest code possible for VB.

Enjoy!
